## Problem 1
- Scenario: As head of the TSA, you set the rules for screening passengers at airport checkpoints.

Christmas is coming soon. Many people are hurrying to take flights back home and gather with their family. So the airport is super crowded at this time. Due to the limited number of screening machines, people need to wait at the checkpoints for a long time.
- Assumptions:
  - Every passenger's ID (passport Number), name, birthday, nationality and other information are needed for checking.
  - Every passenger will carry some personal belongings containing some personal information.
  - Every passenger needs to send all personal baggages to the screening machines and go through body scanner.
  - To save the time, some special quick-pass channels should be opened when the checkpoint is very crowded. 
  - Screening machine cannot check all the potential threats. If necessary, TSA needs to check the passenger's personal belongs manually.  
- Assets:
  - Safety for the public environment of airport including public facilities, airport property, aircraft. No acts of terrorism, sabotage and threat to life should be allowed.
  - Safety of passenger body and personal belongings. The screen machine should do no damage to passenger's baggage. The body scanner should pose no threat to the health of the passenger.
  - Privacy of the passenger including the content in passenger's personal baggage, passenger-specific images, flight number etc. 
  - Precious time of passenger. The TSA should ensure the checking time won't be too long, otherwise passenger may miss the flight.
  
- Threats:
  - Metallic and non-metallic threats, including weapons and explosives which could pose threat to infrastructure of the airport.
  - Passenger's information(ID, name, birthday, nationality) may be collected at checkpoint. Those information should not be leaked or stolen.
  - Body scanner should do no harm to the health of the passenger. Screening machines should do no damage to passenger's baggage.
  - The time of passenger should not be wasted at the checkpoint. Make sure passengers can catch up on the flight.
- Countermeasures:
  -
